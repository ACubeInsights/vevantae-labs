# Vevantae Labs Theme & Design System

This document outlines the core design principles, color palette, and component styling guidelines for the Vevantae Labs website.

## 1. Core Philosophy

Our design aims to be:

-   **Elegant & Minimalist:** Clean lines, generous whitespace, and a focus on typography.
-   **Modern & Premium:** High-quality imagery, subtle animations, and a refined color scheme.
-   **Trustworthy & Scientific:** Clear information hierarchy, consistent branding, and accessible design.

## 2. Color Palette

The color scheme is built around a primary palette of black and a light golden accent, with supporting neutrals.

### Primary Palette
-   `#000000` (Black): Used for primary backgrounds, text, and structural elements.
-   `#D7B56D` (Light Golden): Our primary accent color. Used for links, buttons, highlights, and key brand moments.

### Secondary Palette
-   `#FCF5E4` (Cream): A warm off-white for backgrounds and cards to create a softer feel.
-   `#5C7A62` (Muted Green): Used for secondary accents, particularly in the logo and where a touch of natural color is needed.

### Neutrals
-   `#FFFFFF` (White): For text on dark backgrounds and clean highlights.
-   `#FAFAFA` (Off-White): Light backgrounds.
-   `#E5E5E5` (Light Gray): Borders and dividers.
-   `#A3A3A3` (Medium Gray): Secondary text and disabled states.
-   `#333333` (Dark Gray): Darker backgrounds and panels.

## 3. Typography

-   **Headings:** A light, elegant sans-serif font (e.g., a font with weights like 'Extralight', 'Light').
-   **Body:** A clean, readable sans-serif font for paragraphs and UI elements.
-   **Styling:** Use of italics and font-weight variations to create hierarchy and emphasis.

## 4. Spacing & Layout

-   **Grid:** A consistent grid system (e.g., 12-column) is used for layout.
-   **Spacing:** A base unit (e.g., 4px or 8px) is used for margins, padding, and gaps to ensure consistent rhythm.
-   **Whitespace:** Generous use of whitespace is crucial to maintain a clean and uncluttered aesthetic.

## 5. Iconography

-   **Style:** Use `lucide-react` for clean, modern, and consistent line icons.
-   **Usage:** Icons should be meaningful and support the content, not just be decorative.
-   **Color:** Icons typically inherit the accent color (`#D7B56D`) or a neutral text color.

## 6. Component Styling Guidelines

### Buttons
-   **Primary:** Solid background (accent color) with contrasting text.
-   **Secondary:** Outlined or a subtle background color.
-   **Hover/Focus:** Clear visual feedback, such as a change in background color, border, or a subtle shadow.

### Cards
-   **Background:** Typically use a cream or off-white background.
-   **Border:** A subtle 1px border.
-   **Shadow:** A soft, diffused box-shadow on hover to create a sense of elevation.

### Carousels
-   **Navigation:** Should be intuitive, either through scroll or with clear next/previous buttons.
-   **Items:** Consistent sizing and spacing between items.
-   **Interactivity:** Hover effects on carousel items to indicate they are clickable.

### Forms
-   **Inputs:** Clean, simple input fields with a clear focus state (e.g., a highlighted border).
-   **Labels:** Clearly associated with their respective inputs.
-   **Validation:** Clear and accessible error messages.
